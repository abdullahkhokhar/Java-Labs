NAME     : Fill style selector
OWNER    : 
PRIORITY :
ESTIMATE : 
AS A     : user
I WANT   : To be able to select the current drawing style (filled or outline), to be applied
           to subsequent shapes. Example: 
           		selects fill style solid
           		mode circle
           		draw a circle
           		draw a circle
           		mode rectangle
           		draw a rectangle
           		select fill style outline
           		draw a rectangle
           		draw a rectangle
           		select mode squiggle
           		draw a squiggle
           	results in two solid circles and a solid rectangle as well as
           	two outlined rectangles and a squiggle
SO THAT  :
